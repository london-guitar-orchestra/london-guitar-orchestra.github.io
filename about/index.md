We meet every Tuesday evening in Holborn. The format of the evening is:

Solo masterlass (18:45-20:00)
-----------------------------

The solo class is designed to help players with technique and confidence when performing. 
It is a friendly class where other members are very supportive with help and advice.

Between classes we have tea and Trevor's home-made biscuits.

Guitar orchestra (20:15-22:00)
------------------------------
The Guitar Orchestra provides an opportunity to play classical music in a group 
with other people. The music can be quite challenging but we also play simple 
and fun music and occasionally perform in concert.

Sound good? Read more about (joining)[/joining]!.
